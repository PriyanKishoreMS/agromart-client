This has made a lot of NGOs take up the issue at hand and focus steadfastly in growing trees and plants. We at Sustainable World Peace  have committed to making the earth greener. We constantly conduct environment drives and campaigns to not just bring awareness on the importance of growing plants, but also to practice what is preached. There are a lot of seeds sowed  as a part of our campaigns and we are driven to increase the count further more in the future.',
